\section{Background}
The current system for monitoring rivers and bodies of water involves building small concrete huts that record and store data locally. The cost of building these huts makes them prohibitive and is inefficient with today's technology. Some even requiring a person being sent periodically to collect this information manually. \citep{SEPA2018} Figure I shows one of these monitoring stations found along the River Beauly.

In 2005 the WFD reported 285 type 1a and 1b “at risk” bodies of water. \citep{SEPA2007} By 2006  253 stations such as the one pictured in Figure 1 were in place across Scotland representing 10\% of the country’s total water bodies and 26\% of the 989  “at risk” rivers as of 2009. \citep{SEPA2009}

\end{figure}
The reason for this can be attributed to the cost of these monitoring stations, with the solution proposed in this paper cost could be greatly reduced to a fraction of this. \citep{SEPA2016} Alternatives to this using more modern technology are still highly expensive and cost prohibitive \citep{TheIoTMarketplace2015}

\subsection{Open Source}

Attempts have been made to tackle some of the problems such as flooding \citep{Castillo-Effen2004} though few of these projects cover the many aspects this project will. Many commercial applications developed are built with a propriety licence which prohibits the reading or sharing of the code. This is the antithesis of Open Source, which has slowly been gaining traction from large companies, dispelling the myth that it is hobbyist code at best. For example, Red Hat Inc. was valued at 35 billion during its recent acquisition \citep{Hammond2018}. This is no better seen than in the worldwide adoption of Apache, a \textit{http daemon} that runs many websites from hobby to major company (Apple.com, Adobe.com etc.) \citep{W3techs2018}. Further projects such as the Linux kernel, originating from Linus Torvalds has seen a massive adoption, most strikingly in the supercomputing market where it has completely dominated the top 500 supercomputers (ranked by TFlops). \citep{Top5002018}

The field of environmental monitoring is largely untapped, with much of the current solutions being closed source and expensive \citep{TheIoTMarketplace2015}. There is little interaction from the community and even less interoperability from the technologies deployed. There's also the consumer aspect, where environmentally conscious individuals want to help monitor the local environment. An attempt was made to crowd source the collection of atmospheric data \citep{OKLabStuttgart2015} across Europe and beyond with small sensor units developed during workshops.

\end{figure}
This model of crowd sourced deployment means anyone can get involved, and it ensures that the data is freely available to all. This is also a key principle for this project, and the Open Database License \citep{OpenDataCommons2011} will ensure the data can be used freely.
