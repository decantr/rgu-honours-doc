abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) ideology can be looked as a highly dynamic and radically distributed networked system composed of a very large number of identifiable smart objects. These objects are able to communicate and to interact among themselves, with end-users or other entities in the network. Entering the era of Internet of Things, the use of small, cheap and flexible computer hardware that allow end-user programming become present. One of them, considered in this paper, is the Raspberry Pi, fully customizable and programmable small computer board. Comparative analysis of its key elements and performances with some of current existing IoT prototype platforms have shown that despite few disadvantages, the Raspberry Pi remains an inexpensive computer with its very successfully usage in diverse range of research applications in IoT vision.},

abstract = {Bluetooth is a telecommunications industry specification operating in an unlicensed frequency band of 2.4 GHz that describes how mobile phones, computers, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) can be easily interconnected using a short-range wireless connection. In this study, a personal area network (PAN) was set up using three personal computers, two Bluetooth universal serial bus dongles, one serial Bluetooth module and also a Bluetooth mobile phone. A graphical user interface (GUI) using Visual Basic 6.0 was built to display the system accessibility such as file and system properties, transferring text files, chatting program and network detection by Bluetooth's service discovery protocol (SDP). The Bluetooth system performance is observed between two Bluetooth devices using the GUI and analyzed in terms of types, sizes of file and separation distance (within 8 meters), which were measured against transmission delay. The findings show that the transmission delay varies exponentially with the types and sizes of file even with different types of Bluetooth devices and increases with separation distance},

@article{Kajikawa2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Bluetooth is a low-energy consumption communication technology and a prospective communication method for emergency situations. A Classic Bluetooth communication network has been proposed and designed to establish an emergency mobile ad hoc network (hereinafter referred to as Classic Bluetooth MANETs). In Classic Bluetooth MANETs, a terminal can cause an excess of connection retries and connection conflicts. These problems can slow down the time it takes to establish connections. Therefore, time-consuming connection establishment causes the degradation of the operation rate in Bluetooth MANETs. In this paper, we propose a new fast connection establishment method by using both Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technologies. We have also implemented and evaluated our proposed method through real terminal experiments. As a result, we have confirmed that the connection latency of our proposed method is almost 75 percent lower than that of Classic Bluetooth MANETs and the energy consumption of our proposed method is less than that of Classic Bluetooth MANETs.},

@article{Das2001,
abstract = {Emerging technologies such as Bluetooth are expected to become a ubiquitous solution for providing short range, low power, low cost, pico-cellular wireless connectivity. Bluetooth is a master driven time division duplex (TDD) system that supports an asynchronous channel for data traffic as well as synchronous channels for voice traffic. Data applications running over Bluetooth such as http, ftp and real audio will need transport layer protocols such as TCP and UDP to send packets over the wireless links. In this paper we study several schemes designed to improve the performance of asynchronous data traffic over a Bluetooth piconet that supports multiple active slaves. We propose and compare a number of segmentation and reassembly policies and MAC scheduling algorithms with a view towards enhancing the performance of transport layer sessions. We investigate the effect of different FEC and ARQ schemes at the baseband level, using a two-state Markov channel model for the Bluetooth RF link. We also study how the presence of circuit- switched voice impacts the performance of data traffic},

That is 4 years on a 9 V battery with 1,200 mAh capacity or 2,000 times more efficient than the Arduino Uno.

Locally, each lamp post uses an electronic card for management and a ZigBee tlc network transmits data to a central control unit, which manages the whole isle. The central unit is realized with a Raspberry-Pi control card due to its good computing performance at very low price. Finally, a WiMAX connection was tested and used to remotely control the smart grid, thus overcoming the distance limitations of commercial Wi-Fi networks.
