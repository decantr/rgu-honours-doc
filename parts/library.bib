abstract = { This article presents the ongoing effort in providing the population of the Andean region of Venezuela with a flash-flood alerting system by making use of state-of-the-art wireless communications and information technologies. A key component of the project is a wireless sensor network (WSN) that is used for monitoring the environment and tracking the disaster while it evolves. Currently, the project is at its conceptual inception and system-level design is being carried out. Major design constraints and solutions are presented with an emphasis on the monitoring system based on the WSN.},

abstract = {One oft-cited strategy towards sustainability is improving energy efficiency inside public buildings. In this context, the educational buildings sector presents a very interesting and important case for the monitoring and management of buildings, since it addresses both energy and educational issues. In this work, we present and discuss the hardware IoT infrastructure substrate that provides real-time monitoring in multiple school buildings. We believe that such a system needs to follow an open design approach: rely on hardware-agnostic components that communicate over well-defined open interfaces. We present in detail the design of our hardware components, while also providing insights to the overall system design and a first set of results on their operation. The presented hardware components are utilized as the core hardware devices for GAIA, an EU research project aimed at the educational community. As our system has been deployed and tested in several public school buildings in Greece, we also report on its validation.},

Various methods have been developed to address this problem, and recently a lot of efforts have been devoted to approximate search. In this paper, we present a survey on one of the main solutions, hashing, which has been widely studied since the pioneering work locality sensitive hashing. We divide the hashing algorithms two main categories: locality sensitive hashing, which designs hash functions without exploring the data distribution and learning to hash, which learns hash functions according the data distribution, and review them from various aspects, including hash function design and distance measure and search scheme in the hash coding space.},

One of them, considered in this paper, is the Raspberry Pi, fully customizable and programmable small computer board.

In this study, a personal area network (PAN) was set up using three personal computers, two Bluetooth universal serial bus dongles, one serial Bluetooth module and also a Bluetooth mobile phone. A graphical user interface (GUI) using Visual Basic 6.0 was built to display the system accessibility such as file and system properties, transferring text files, chatting program and network detection by Bluetooth's service discovery protocol (SDP). The Bluetooth system performance is observed between two Bluetooth devices using the GUI and analyzed in terms of types, sizes of file and separation distance (within 8 meters), which were measured against transmission delay. The findings show that the transmission delay varies exponentially with the types and sizes of file even with different types of Bluetooth devices and increases with separation distance},

Bluetooth is a master driven time division duplex (TDD) system that supports an asynchronous channel for data traffic as well as synchronous channels for voice traffic. Data applications running over Bluetooth such as http, ftp and real audio will need transport layer protocols such as TCP and UDP to send packets over the wireless links. In this paper we study several schemes designed to improve the performance of asynchronous data traffic over a Bluetooth piconet that supports multiple active slaves. We propose and compare a number of segmentation and reassembly policies and MAC scheduling algorithms with a view towards enhancing the performance of transport layer sessions. We investigate the effect of different FEC and ARQ schemes at the baseband level, using a two-state Markov channel model for the Bluetooth RF link. We also study how the presence of circuit- switched voice impacts the performance of data traffic},

abstract = {The large-scale, highly integrated, multidisciplinary nature of the LOIS rivers programme meant that certain measurements were common to many LOIS research projects (including water discharge, suspended sediment concentrations, pH, conductivity) or depended upon routine weekly or flood-related sampling (eg. for nutrients, metals and organics). This paper describes the underlying strategy which led to the design of the major observational programme in LOIS rivers and provides information on siting of sample points, field sampling methods, instrumentation and associated chemical analyses. There was a need for field measurements to reflect the full range of river flows and to identify critical points for measurement of flux from, and within, the large-scale study river basins. Tests of manual sampling runs against the time series of river flows indicate good representation of both low to moderate flows and extreme flood events in the LOIS rivers field data. Field and analytical methods for sampling the wide range of chemical determinands (major and minor elements, trace metals, nutrients, inorganic and organic carbon and micro-organic pollutants) are outlined. The first LOIS chemical harmonisation assessment, designed to investigate the comparability and accuracy of the chemical and analytical techniques used by the LOIS community is also reported.},

Using an Arduino Pro Mini, with a simple modification, the power consumption goes down to 54 $\mu$A (0.054 mA) with the 3.3 V version or 23 $\mu$A (0.023 mA) with the 5 V version, in power-down sleep. That is 4 years on a 9 V battery with 1,200 mAh capacity or 2,000 times more efficient than the Arduino Uno.

abstract = {A smart city application has been realized and tested. It is a fully remote controlled isle of lamp posts based on new technologies. It has been designed and organized in different hierarchical layers, which perform local activities to physically control the lamp posts and transmit information with another for remote control. Locally, each lamp post uses an electronic card for management and a ZigBee tlc network transmits data to a central control unit, which manages the whole isle. The central unit is realized with a Raspberry-Pi control card due to its good computing performance at very low price. Finally, a WiMAX connection was tested and used to remotely control the smart grid, thus overcoming the distance limitations of commercial Wi-Fi networks. The isle has been realized and tested for some months in the field.},

@article{Kajikawa2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE. Bluetooth is a low-energy consumption communication technology and a prospective communication method for emergency situations. A Classic Bluetooth communication network has been proposed and designed to establish an emergency mobile ad hoc network (hereinafter referred to as Classic Bluetooth MANETs). In Classic Bluetooth MANETs, a terminal can cause an excess of connection retries and connection conflicts. These problems can slow down the time it takes to establish connections. Therefore, time-consuming connection establishment causes the degradation of the operation rate in Bluetooth MANETs. In this paper, we propose a new fast connection establishment method by using both Bluetooth Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technologies. We have also implemented and evaluated our proposed method through real terminal experiments. As a result, we have confirmed that the connection latency of our proposed method is almost 75 percent lower than that of Classic Bluetooth MANETs and the energy consumption of our proposed method is less than that of Classic Bluetooth MANETs.},
