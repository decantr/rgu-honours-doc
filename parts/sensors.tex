\section{Sensors}

The collection of the river data will be the trickiest part of the project. To collect water level currently a wire is laid across the river and a buoy attached to the middle, the sag in the wire can then be used to calculate depth. \citep{SEPA2016} An alternative solution involves using an ultrasonic sensor to judge the distance between the sensor and the water. \citep{AravindJayan2016} This method has the advantage of being a low physical footprint solution to monitoring.
